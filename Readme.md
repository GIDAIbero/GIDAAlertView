# Description

GIDAAlertView is a subclass of UIAlertView; presenting alerts with a flat background, and different styles. Some alerts do not contain accept or cancel buttons, and just display and image or an activity indicator. There is also a progress loading alert which given a url it downloads a file and displays the download progress. As it is a UIAlertView subclass, it is automatically centered in iPhones and iPads. 

iOS 5 or newer is required `(Has not been tested in lower iOS)`
